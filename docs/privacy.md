# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 28, 2026

## 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how **Card Price Lookup** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Card Price Lookup Chrome Extension ("Extension").

> **Important:** Use of Card Price Lookup is subject to our **[Terms of Service](terms)**. By installing or using the Extension, you agree to those Terms.

The Extension allows users to manually capture trading card images from content visible in their browser and retrieve market comparison data ("comps").

We collect only the data necessary to operate the Extension.

### 1.1 Chrome Web Store Compliance
**Limited Use Disclosure:** Use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Chrome Web Store User Data Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/user-data-policy), including the **Limited Use** requirements. We do not sell user data, use it for advertising, or use it to determine creditworthiness.

## 2. User-Initiated Image Capture

The Extension does not automatically scrape or monitor livestreams or marketplaces.

Images are processed only when:

* A user explicitly activates the Extension, and
* The user intentionally captures a visible card image.

Captured images:

* Are transmitted securely to our backend for identification.
* Are processed to extract card attributes such as player name, year, set, card number, parallel, or grade.
* Are not sold or used for marketing.
* Are not used to train AI models.
* Are not permanently stored.

We do not claim ownership of third-party platform content.
