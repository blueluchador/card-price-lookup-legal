# Refund Policy

**Last Updated:** February 28, 2026

This Refund Policy applies to monthly subscription plans for Card Price Lookup operated by **Blue Luchador LLC**.

---

## 1. Monthly Subscription Plans

Card Price Lookup is offered on a monthly recurring subscription basis with usage-based tiers.

Each plan includes a defined usage limit per billing cycle.

Billing occurs in advance on a recurring monthly basis unless canceled.

---

## 2. Usage Tiers

Each subscription tier includes a specific number of scans or comp lookups per monthly billing period.

* Usage does not roll over to future months.
* Unused usage is forfeited at the end of each billing cycle.
* Downgrades or cancellations do not result in prorated refunds for unused usage.

---

## 3. Refund Eligibility

Because the Service provides immediate access to proprietary functionality and market data, subscription fees are generally non-refundable.

However, refunds may be issued at our sole discretion in limited circumstances, including:

* Duplicate charges
* Billing errors
* Verified technical failures preventing access to the Service

Refund requests must be submitted within 7 days of the charge.

---

## 4. Non-Refundable Situations

Refunds will not be issued for:

* Failure to cancel before renewal
* Partial billing periods
* Unused usage within a billing cycle
* Dissatisfaction after use of the Service
* Account suspension or termination due to violation of the Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy
* Usage exceeding plan limits prior to cancellation

---

## 5. Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

Initiating a chargeback without first contacting support may result in:

* Immediate suspension or termination of the account
* Permanent restriction from future use

We reserve the right to dispute fraudulent or abusive chargebacks.

---

## 6. Cancellation

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your billing provider.

Cancellation prevents future renewals but does not retroactively refund prior charges.

You will retain access to your plan features until the end of the current billing cycle.

---

## 7. Plan Changes

If you upgrade your plan, changes may take effect immediately and may result in a prorated charge.

If you downgrade your plan, the change may take effect at the next billing cycle.
